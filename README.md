# MTE546Project

## Welcome to the code repository for Pose Fusion Net, Group 7's Sensor Fusion Project

### How to run the code and models
#### Accessing the code
To access the code, clone this repository as both the code and data are necessary to run everything correctly.
AFTER CLONING THE REPO: Please download the processed data from Google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5q3zAbxE4njVQDdprp0c7E3WNSxum00/view?usp=drive_link . This file was too large to include in the repository itself. Once downloaded, place it in the data folder. 

#### Preprocessing
The preprocessing folder contains its own README and notebook. The preprocessing was carried out in Google Colab with a mounted drive.  A similar process must be followed to reperform the preprocessing, but the processed data is also contained in the data folder if you wish to just view the model's training and outputs!

#### Model
The `546CodeSubmission.ipynb` notebook and the data folder (once the processed data is downloaded) contain everything necessary to view the model, training, validation, testing, and outputs. The output plots and results used in the report are already loaded if that is what you wish to view.

To run the model yourself, run the code cells in order and verify that the paths are correct. They were configured correctly to run after cloning the git repo, but please contact Afraz Hemraj should the code not be running.  

The data folder contains the candidate models that were used in the report, and the notebook uses these files and models for visualization. To rerun the code from scratch and generate new models, some alterations must be made to the code. If that is required please contact a group member.
